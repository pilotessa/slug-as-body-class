== Description ==

Want to have css styling rules for individual pages or posts?

This plugin adds a unique class to the body tag of the html. The added class is formatted as "[post_type]-[post_name]". For a page with slug (= post_type) "about" it will be "page-about", and for a post named "today" it will be "post-today". Currently no slug will be added for archive and category pages. Please let us know if you need this and we will add it.

= example =

Say you want to have a red title on your contact page. With this plugin all you need to do is add this line to your css:

body.page-contact h1 {
	color : red;
}
